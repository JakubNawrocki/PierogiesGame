# Pierogies Runner - Animation & Movement Enhancements

## Overview
I've successfully enhanced the Pierogies Runner game with smoother animations, transitions, and visual effects to create a more professional and polished gaming experience. The game now features fluid movement, responsive controls, and engaging visual feedback throughout gameplay.

## Implemented Enhancements

### Movement Improvements
- **Variable Jump Height**: Added variable jump height based on button press duration for more precise control
- **Easing Functions**: Implemented easing functions for smoother acceleration/deceleration
- **Smoother Camera**: Enhanced camera follow with improved lerp values and subtle zoom effects
- **Delta-based Movement**: Ensured consistent movement speed regardless of frame rate
- **Momentum Physics**: Added realistic momentum to horizontal movement

### Animation Enhancements
- **Squash & Stretch**: Implemented squash and stretch principles for jumps and landings
- **Transition Animations**: Added smooth transitions between player states (running, flying, falling)
- **Running Animation**: Added subtle bobbing animation while running
- **Landing Effects**: Created special effects for landing after jumps
- **Anticipation Frames**: Added anticipation frames before major actions

### Visual Effects
- **Particle Systems**: Added dust particles for jumps and landings
- **Collection Effects**: Enhanced pierogi collection with particle bursts and scaling
- **Score Animations**: Added floating score text and animated counter
- **Screen Effects**: Implemented subtle screen flash effects for important events
- **Impact Feedback**: Enhanced collision feedback with visual cues

### Scene Transitions
- **Fade Transitions**: Replaced abrupt scene changes with smooth fades
- **Animated UI**: Added entrance/exit animations for UI elements
- **Game Over Screen**: Enhanced game over screen with staggered animations
- **Restart Transition**: Added smooth transition when restarting the game

### UI Improvements
- **Button Animations**: Added hover and click effects for buttons
- **Text Effects**: Implemented text scaling and color effects for important messages
- **Score Counter**: Created animated score counter with smooth value changes

## Technical Implementation
- Created new particle assets for dust and collection effects
- Implemented proper delta-time calculations for consistent animation speeds
- Added tween chains for complex animations
- Enhanced collision and hit feedback
- Optimized performance for smooth gameplay

## Next Steps
1. Further polish character animations with additional frames
2. Add more environmental particle effects for atmosphere
3. Implement sound effects to match the visual feedback
4. Fine-tune difficulty progression
5. Enhance leaderboard UI with animations
