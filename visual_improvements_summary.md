# Pierogies Runner - Visual Improvements Summary

## Overview
I've successfully enhanced the Pierogies Runner game with new visual assets in the requested 8-bit pixel art style. The game now features a cohesive visual theme with custom-designed graphics for all game elements.

## Implemented Visual Improvements

### Character
- Created a new player spritesheet featuring a pierogi character with blue pants and yellow/gold body
- Implemented proper animation frames for running, flying/jumping, falling, hit, and dead states
- Adjusted sprite dimensions and hitboxes for optimal gameplay

### Backgrounds & Environment
- Designed a kitchen-themed main background with warm colors
- Created parallax background layers for depth perception:
  - Far layer with subtle kitchen elements
  - Middle layer with more detailed kitchen items
- Designed a wooden floor/ground element that complements the kitchen theme

### Collectibles & Obstacles
- Created golden pierogi collectible items with distinctive shape
- Designed kitchen-themed obstacles:
  - Knife (vertical obstacle)
  - Kielbasa sausage (horizontal obstacle)
  - Onion (round obstacle)
  - Cheese grater (tall obstacle)
  - Rolling pin (horizontal obstacle)

### UI Elements
- Integrated existing UI elements (pause/play buttons, title banner)
- Ensured all UI elements maintain the 8-bit pixel art style

## Technical Fixes
- Fixed asset loading issues by ensuring proper file paths
- Adjusted sprite dimensions and collision parameters
- Ensured assets are properly served by the development server

## Next Steps
1. Further polish animations and transitions
2. Add particle effects for collectibles and obstacles
3. Implement additional visual feedback for game events
4. Ensure web3 functionality works correctly with token holders
5. Verify and enhance leaderboard functionality
